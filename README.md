### IPL Ticket Booking:

The objective is to create a form for IPL ticket booking via using various web technologies such as HTML, HTML5, CSS, JavaScript, etc and to add alerts to validate the inputs given through the form.


### Watermark Effect:

The objective is to create an HTML form with fields that will behave as placeholders. But, they aren't actual HTML5 placeholders, they are watermarks instead! When the user begins entering text in text field, the watermark must go away.


### Shopping:

The objective here is to create a jQuery webpage which accepts Shipping Address and Billing Address from the user. If the shipping address and billing address are the same, copy the shipping address details to billing address details and make it readonly.
